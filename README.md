# Introduction
This repository contains code files for the Neural Networks & Computational Intelligence course. 

# How to Run
1. First create a local Python virtual environment to install the dependencies by running the command `python3 -m venv <your_name_choice>`.[^1]
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python3 testing.py` to ensure that all scripts are running properly and that the commands above were completed successfully.
4. You are ready to go!




[^1]: You can skip this part if you are using a global virtual environment to handle your Python dependencies. Be aware that when you run the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command, the process will update the respective modules globally, and might cause compatibility issues with other scripts.
